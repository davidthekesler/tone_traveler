How to Use Tone Traveler:
</Typography>

<Typography variant="caption">

Tone Traveler helps mask the distractions in your environment and focus your mental activity, helping suggest states ranging from highly alert and focused to deep, therapeutic sleep.

The top half of Tone Travelerâ€™s simple yet customizable player allows you to select from a library of sound sources, ranging from slowly evolving melodic drones to more natural soundscapes such as waterfalls, forests, and wind.

The large dial on the center of the screen controls the underlying low-frequency binaural beat for each sound source, and adjusts the pitch of the binaural beat to match the sound source. Information about the suggested brain activity for the frequency selected is displayed underneath the dial as you adjust it, as well as a readout of the specific frequency you're targeting. For more information on binaural beats, see below.

A balance slider on the lower right allows you to adjust the mix between the sound source and the binaural beat, and a master volume slider on the lower left gives you the ability to lower the overall effect in case you want to play it under other programmatic material.

Brain activity produces a variety of electrical patterns, or "brain waves" at different frequencies. These waves can be observed or recorded with an EEG (electroencephalograph) and different frequency ranges of these waves have been shown to correspond with different mind-states, moods, and activities. Research has gone so far as to classify these mind-states into five overarching groups: Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta. Information on these groups and their associated brain states <a href=" https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/04/15/5-types-of-brain-waves-frequencies-gamma-beta-alpha-theta-delta/

A binaural beat is very much akin to the wobble that one hears when tuning an instrument. As tones become very close to each other, the difference between them forms a lower, slower frequency that appears as a sort of beating sound. The periodicity of frequency of this beating sound can then be set to correspond to the frequencies and mind-states associated with the brain's electrical patterns. The correlation may be pseudo-scientific, but the suggestion is that if one listens to a binaural beat with a frequency corresponding to a known activity or state, the mind may be nudged or suggested into adopting that same state.
